# Hi, I'm Fredi

I have a Master's degree in Philosophy and I have concluded that I am passionate about making a meaningful dent in our world. As a means to achieve this, I started learning to code at the programming school [42Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/?gclid=CjwKCAiA0JKfBhBIEiwAPhZXDw4H5-SlQtCjI4UeUxtBLCjbAbaIRvnXh2Xd_n7XhlPpnoXJQT3XPhoC0bQQAvD_BwE).

I have worked with a variety of different languages and technologies. While I am still developing my skills, I have a good understanding and feel comfortable with the following:

## Current Project

### ft_transcendence

As the last and biggest 42 project [Dom](https://github.com/Domas182), [Milton](https://github.com/Pyr-0), [Arno](https://github.com/AF200), [Gohar](https://github.com/goharalisiddiqui) and I wrote a multiplayer online version of the game Pong. The backend is written in NestJS, using PostgreSQL and TypeORM for the database. The frontend is written in React.

## Some of my Projects

### [IRC Server](https://github.com/Fredi-B/42_ft_irc)

As the first 'bigger' C++ 42 group project ft_irc, [Arno](https://github.com/AF200), [Gohar](https://github.com/goharalisiddiqui) and I implemented a basic Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, allowing users to join and participate in online chat rooms.

### [LEMP Stack](https://github.com/Fredi-B/42_inception)

In the 42 project Inception, I gained experience with Docker and setting up a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP). I acquired a solid understanding of how to use Docker to manage and deploy web applications using Nginx, MySQL, and PHP in a containerized environment.

### [Minishell](https://github.com/Fredi-B/42_minishell)

I worked with [Arno](https://github.com/AF200) on the 42 group project Minishell, a minimalist Unix shell written in C. Our goal was to allow users to execute commands and navigate the file system. Working with Arno was a great opportunity to learn and bring our strengths to the project. Despite the challenges, we successfully created a functional Minishell and improved our teamworking skills.
